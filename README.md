## 🚀 Featured Project

### ☀️ Solar Radiation Prediction using Saudi Arabia Dataset

![Solar Radiation Project](Screenshots/homepage.jpg)

This project predicts **Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)** using historical weather data from Saudi Arabia. It leverages advanced machine learning models to build an accurate forecasting system and deploys it as a web application for real-time GHI prediction.

- **ML Workflow:** End-to-end pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment.
- **Tech Stack:** Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy), JavaScript, HTML.
- **Web Application:** Interactive dashboard for real-time GHI predictions.
- **Dataset:** Saudi Arabia weather data (2015–2020).
- **Repositories:**
